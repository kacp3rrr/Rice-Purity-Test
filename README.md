# Intro

The Rice Purity Test is a test that assesses your "degree of innocence" based on a checklist of actions provided for you to complete. The more of said actions you've done, the lower your purity score is.

This project is an open-source example of the Rice Purity Test that is heavily commented, so that the average person understands just how the test works. The [source code of the original rice purity test](https://github.com/ricepurity/ricepurity.github.com) is very complex, for whatever reason, and I feel like the source code can be simplified down a lot, to the point where it's essentially user-friendly, hence this project.

# Navigation Guide

All source code lives in inside [the src folder](src)

The more important component of the website is the [script.js file.](src/script.js) The code has been commented step-by-step to allow easy understanding of the website's inner workings.

You can also have a look at the [index.html](src/index.html) to see how the JavaScript interacts with the HTML, but that, along with the [CSS](src/styles.css) may be a bit confusing.
